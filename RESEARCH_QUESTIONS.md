# Research Questions

## Primary Questions

### RQ1: What barriers do dyslexic students face?
- Which aspects of traditional interfaces cause difficulty?
- How do reading-intensive problems impact performance?
- What role does working memory play?

### RQ2: How does ColorPath address these barriers?
- Does color-coding reduce cognitive load?
- Does stepwise progression improve comprehension?
- Does gentle feedback reduce anxiety?

### RQ3: What is the effectiveness of the color-sequenced approach?
- Do students follow the color order correctly?
- Does visual-first design reduce reading requirements?
- How do students perceive the color system?

## Evaluation Methods

### Pilot Study (2-3 participants)
- Think-aloud protocol
- Task completion (2-3 problems)
- Post-task interview
- Metrics: misclicks, hints, time per step

### Full Study (Future)
- Within-group design: same students over multiple sessions
- Control group: traditional text-based interface
- Experimental group: ColorPath 
- Measures: accuracy, time, confidence, retention

## Success Criteria

**Pilot**: Identify usability issues, gather feedback, refine tool.

**Full Study**: Significant learning improvement (p < 0.05), positive feedback (SUS > 70), high completion rate (>80%).
