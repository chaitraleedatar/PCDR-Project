# Pilot Study Plan

## Overview

**Purpose**: Formative evaluation with 2-3 participants to identify usability issues and gather feedback.

**Duration**: 30-45 minutes per participant

**Participants**: Students enrolled in/have taken intro CS/discrete math, preferably including dyslexic students.

## Protocol

### 1. Introduction (5 min)
Explain tool purpose, think-aloud protocol, obtain consent.

### 2. Pre-Study Questionnaire (5 min)
- Background: Year, courses taken, comfort with logic (1-5 scale)
- Prior experience: How they've learned logic, challenges faced

### 3. Training (5 min)
Show color system and basic workflow. Allow 2-3 minutes exploration.

### 4. Task Session (15-20 min)
- **Task 1**: Simple problem (P ∧ Q) - 5-7 min
- **Task 2**: Moderate problem (default) - 7-10 min
- **Task 3**: Alternative problem (if time) - 5-7 min

**Observe**: Color system understanding, sequence following, confusions, hint usage.

### 5. Post-Study Interview (10-15 min)

**Key Questions**:
1. Overall thoughts on the tool and how it altered learning?
2. What did you think of the color-coding system?
3. Did colors help you understand the sequence?
4. Were any colors confusing?
5. What did you think about the feedback when you made mistakes?
6. Were hints helpful?
7. Did you use text-to-speech? How helpful?
8. What was the most difficult part?
9. What would you change?
10. How does this compare to how you've learned logic before?

## Data Collection

**Quantitative**: Time per step, color errors, answer errors, hints used, completion rate.

**Qualitative**: Think-aloud transcripts, interview responses, observation notes.

## Expected Outcomes

- Identify 3+ major usability issues
- Validate color system understanding
- Gather feedback on accessibility features
- Refine tool before larger study
