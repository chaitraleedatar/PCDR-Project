# How It Works

## Quick Start

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Select a problem (start with Problem 2 - easiest)
3. Click a color → Answer the question
4. Follow the sequence: 🟦 Blue → 🟪 Purple → 🟨 Yellow → 🟩 Green → 🟧 Orange

## Example: Problem 2 (P ∧ Q, P = T, Q = T)

**Step 1**: Click 🟪 Purple → Answer "What is P?" → **True**  
**Step 2**: Click 🟪 Purple → Answer "What is Q?" → **True**  
**Step 3**: Click 🟩 Green → Answer "Evaluate P ∧ Q:" → **True**  
**Step 4**: Click 🟧 Orange → Answer "Final answer:" → **True**

Done! See summary.

## Color Meanings

- **🟦 Blue** = Find groups/parentheses
- **🟪 Purple** = Evaluate single letters (P, Q, R...)
- **🟨 Yellow** = Simplify or apply NOT (¬)
- **🟩 Green** = Combine parts (AND, OR, etc.)
- **🟧 Orange** = Finish and get final answer

## Mistakes Are OK

- Wrong color? Voice tells you the correct one if misclick occurs
- Wrong answer? Hints appear automatically to lead you in the right direction
- Stuck? Wait 6 seconds for a spoken hint

The tool is gentle - it helps you learn, does not punish for mistakes.

**Minimal reading**: Visual cues show what to do.

**Gentle feedback**: Mistakes trigger helpful hints, not failure messages.

**Voice support**: Everything can be spoken aloud.

**Clear sequencing**: Color order makes logical flow obvious.
